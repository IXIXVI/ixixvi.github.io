Yining Zhou is a PhD student in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Northeast Normal University. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the School of Statistics and Data Science of Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics. My research interest lies in Big data clustering and massive data sampling. As a newcomer entering the scientific research arena, I am trying to form my research taste, accumulate my experience and papers, and broaden my horizon.
